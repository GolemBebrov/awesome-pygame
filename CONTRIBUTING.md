# Contributing
Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guidelines
- Add one link per Pull Request.
    - Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
    - No need to add "awesome", or "pygame" to the title as it's already implied.
    - Write down the reason why the library is awesome.
- Add the link: `- [project-name](https://github.com/...) - A short description`
    - Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
    - It is advisable to use the project description directly if it fits.
- Add a section if needed.
    - Add the section title to Table of Contents, then add your link under the new section.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

### Gentle reminder:
- If you're submitting your own project, makes sure it has been a while since you started developing it and it's well-tested. Let's not fill up the list with unmaintained, empty projects.
- The projects have to tool pygame or use it in some way or other. There may be few exceptions because it helps pygame development crucially, but let's try to keep all projects pygame-related.
